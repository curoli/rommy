# 🕊️ Rommy

**Rommy** is a lightweight Rust CLI app that makes pair programming with AI assistants or remote humans easier, more efficient, and more robust.  
Rommy runs Bash commands or scripts, captures all input/output, and optionally streams everything live to the terminal — with color highlighting.  
The results are saved in a structured **.rommy file** containing metadata, command details, stdout, and stderr.

The name **Rommy** is inspired by *Rommie*, the AI avatar of the starship *Andromeda Ascendant* from the TV series *Andromeda*.

## ✨ Features

- 🪶 **Simple command execution**
  ```bash
  rommy run -- cargo test
````

Runs the command, streams live output to the terminal, and stores everything automatically.

* 🗃️ **Automatic output organization**
  If `--out` is omitted, Rommy uses a default path and filename based on time and command:

  ```
  ~/.local/state/rommy/2025/10/26/165900.cargo_clippy.rommy
  ```

* 🧭 **Smart defaults**
  Default output root follows OS conventions:

  * Linux: `~/.local/state/rommy`
  * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Rommy`
  * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rommy`
  * Or override:

    ```bash
    export ROMMY_ROOT=/path/to/custom
    ```

* 🖊️ **Scratch script editor**
  If no command or script is provided, Rommy automatically opens your preferred editor (`$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL`) to create a temporary Bash script, runs it, and records the output.

* 🎧 **Live streaming with colors**

  * `stdout` and `stderr` are streamed live to your terminal while being captured to file.
  * **stderr** is shown in **yellow**, and Rommy’s own messages (e.g. “Wrote …”) appear in **cyan**.
  * Disable streaming or colors:

    ```bash
    rommy run --no-stream --color=never -- cargo clippy
    ```

* 📜 **Structured format**
  Each `.rommy` file contains:

  ```
  <<<META>>>
  timestamp: ...
  exit_code: ...
  <<<COMMAND>>>
  $ cargo test
  <<<STDOUT>>>
  ...
  <<<STDERR>>>
  ...
  <<<END>>>
  ```

## 🚀 Installation

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Or directly from Git:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/fiverays-ai/rommy
```

### Requirements

* Rust ≥ 1.75
* (optional) `bash` for script mode

---

## 🧩 Examples

### 1️⃣ Run a simple command

```bash
rommy run -- cargo build
```

### 2️⃣ Run a script

```bash
rommy run --script build.sh
```

### 3️⃣ Run interactively (no command given)

```bash
rommy run
```

→ Rommy opens your editor, you write a script, save, close — and Rommy executes it.

### 4️⃣ Custom output file

```bash
rommy run --out results/mytest.rommy -- cargo test
```

### 5️⃣ Disable live streaming

```bash
rommy run --no-stream -- cargo check
```

## 📂 File format

Rommy files are both human-readable and machine-friendly.
Each file consists of well-defined blocks:

```
<<<META>>>
timestamp: 2025-10-22T15:30:45Z
exit_code: 0
duration_ms: 11234
<<<COMMAND>>>
$ cargo test
<<<STDOUT>>>
running 3 tests
test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed;
<<<STDERR>>>
<<<END>>>
```
